I’m Jacob Jannicelli, a student at Villanova University studying MIS, Business Analytics, and AI / ML.  
I’m especially interested in using data and optimization to make better decisions in sports and operations.

Outside of class, I:

- Work as Commissioner for Villanova Intramural Sports  
- Build side projects in R and Python (sports models, scheduling tools, dashboards)  
- Follow MLB and NBA analytics closely  

I’m always open to talking about internships, research, or collaboration.
