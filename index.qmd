# Hi, I’m Jacob 👋

I’m a Villanova University senior student studying **Management Information Systems** and **Business Analytics** with a minor in **AI / Machine Learning**.  
I build data-driven tools for **sports analytics**, **optimization**, and **process automation**.

Some things I’ve worked on:

- A **pRating** model that blends Statcast pitch data and Location+ into a holistic pitcher metric  
- An **NBA roster optimizer** that uses real salary and performance data under a salary-cap constraint  
- An **AI-assisted intramural scheduling system** that generates schedules, referee assignments, and scoresheets  
- Coursework projects in ML, BI, and optimization using R, Python, SQL, and OR-Tools  

Use the navigation above to explore my **Projects**, **Experience**, and how to **Contact** me.
