# Hi, I’m Jacob 👋

I’m an Honors undergraduate senior at Villanova University studying **Management Information Systems** and **Business Analytics**, with a minor in **AI / Machine Learning**. 
I build data-driven tools for **sports analytics**, **optimization**, and **process automation**.

Some things I’ve worked on:

- A **pRating** model that blends Statcast pitch data and Location+ into a holistic MLB pitcher metric  
- An **NFL go-route analytics dashboard** measuring WR separation and QB completed-over-expected on deep throws  
- A **real estate portfolio optimization app** that explores risk–return tradeoffs under budget constraints  
- Coursework projects in **ML, BI, and optimization** using R, Python, SQL, and OR-Tools  

Use the navigation above to explore my **Projects**, **Experience**, and **About** pages.
